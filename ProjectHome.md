This Code aims to help readers implement their own multi-class kernel SVMs or understand how numerical algorithm works for solving SVMs, or who want to run experiments on Matlab Platform without third party SVM libraries.

For easy reading the code, see the paper:

Koby Crammer and Yoram Singer,
On the Algorithmic Implementation of Multiclass Kernel-based Vector Machines,
Journal of Machine Learning Research 2 (2001) 265-292

Especially, variables in the code correspond to the same notations in the reference paper.


3 Files included:

MultiClassSVMExample.m

MultiClassSVMTrain.m

MultiClassSVMTest.m

The first file shows an example how to run the implementation. The other two implement the training and testing procedures respectively.
